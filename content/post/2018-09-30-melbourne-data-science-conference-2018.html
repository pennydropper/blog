<p>The 2018 Melbourne Data Science Conference (MeDaScIn Conference) featured data science career advice from 6 presenters.</p>
<p>Overall, the conference presented some good common sense career advice though there was little “new” material.</p>
<p>This blog post shows notes taken during the presentations.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.datasciencemelbourne.com/medascin2018/">conference website</a> was down at the time of writing this blog but the link is provided anyway.</p>

<h3>Scott Wilson: How to Engage Executives and the Boardroom</h3>
<p>Scott Wilson, the founder of <a href="http://www.wilsonai.com/">Wilson AI</a>, presented on “How to Engage Executives and the Boardroom”.</p>
<p>My impression of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilsondscott/">Scott</a> was that he is about my age (51), professionally presented and an engaging presenter.</p>
<p>Scott’s key points were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The average age of directors of ASX100 companies is 61.9 years.</p></li>
<li>Directors natural state is to assess risk and outcomes.<br />
</li>
<li>Pressure to maintain the status quo.<br />
</li>
<li><p>Surprisingly have little influence.</p></li>
<li><p>When presenting, always focus on the outcome (rather than the method to arrive at the recommendation).</p></li>
<li>The CEO (and senior executives) are the most important stakeholders.<br />
</li>
<li>They control the money.<br />
</li>
<li><p>They manage and allocate resources.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Always follow the money:<br />
* Revenue, spend, cost, impact.</p>
<p>Departments with a reputation for dark arts, “black box”, “black magic” or with no outcomes<br />
=<br />
candidates for cost cutting or outsourcing.</p>
<p><strong>How to be a hero</strong><br />
1. Engage the CEO and the C-suite (and then the board).<br />
2. Align to their KPIs and company strategy.<br />
3. Follow the money and focus on outcomes.<br />
4. Keep it (the data science) simple.<br />
5. Execute with speed, again and again.</p>
<p>Share the outcomes loud and proud.</p>

<h3>Felicity Splatt from PwC</h3>
<p>I missed the title of Felicity’s presentation but it was about overcoming “Imposter Syndrome”.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felicity-splatt/">Felicity</a> is a young (to me) Senior Manager at PwC.</p>
<p>I was amused by the topic of her presentation (Imposter Syndrome) given that Felicity has a PhD from Innsbruck University.</p>
<p><strong>Felicity’s key points: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Presented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining">CRISP-DM methodology</a>.</p></li>
<li>Understand the lineage of every component of the data.<br />
</li>
<li><p>Discussions with data domain experts are often hugely rewarded with gaining key insights.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Advice for data scientists to avoid imposter syndrome.<br />
1. Accept that no one knows everything.<br />
2. Understand your likes and dislikes with data science.<br />
3. Understand the expectations in the role.<br />
4. Remain curious and informed by attending Meetups and conferences.<br />
5. Build a diverse team / support network.<br />
6. Invest in continuous learning.</p>

<h3>Eugene Dubossarsky: What data scientists should ask a propsective employer</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-dubossarsky-09208a1/">Dr Eugene Dubossarsky</a> is a director and principal trainer presciient.com.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a worringly high level of churn among data scientists, who either move from employer to employer, become freelance consultants or even drop out of data science all together.</p></li>
<li><p>Data scientists should learn tips for avoiding unsatisfactory jobs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Employer is offering a large salary, but…<br />
* The provided computer is low power (under-speced).<br />
* The IT department does not support new data science initiatives.<br />
* Management has vague, “strange” KPIs or even no KPIs.</p>
<p>Avoid employment where the data science reports into IT.<br />
* Managed like IT, as though it is producing “apps”.</p>
<p>Ideally, the data science function sits in the Intelligence function.<br />
* Attends to new opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>What does a good job look like?</strong><br />
* Tangible objectives.<br />
* Shows that the manager understands to role.<br />
+ Can help you to progress?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Neccessary resources, e.g. adequate hardware.</p></li>
<li><p>How will management support to get the required data.</p></li>
<li><p>How will management help sell the results up the data chain?</p></li>
<li>Where does analytics sit relative to the providers of:<br />
</li>
<li>Data.<br />
</li>
<li>Systems.<br />
</li>
<li><p>Assets.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Parting words:<br />
* A data literacy revolution is coming!</p>

<p>It’s OK to ask for help.</p>
