      <description>Introduction I’m not sure if the March 7 Data Science Melbourne Meetup’s last-minute speaker change classes as serendipity but the 3 replacement speakers presented highly commendable presentations at the last minute.
It’s unfortunate that the planned presenter, Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic from the US and author of Storytelling with Data, was unable to present at the Meetup due to ill health. I’m told that Cole is an inspiring speaker and well worth seeing if possible.</description>

      <description>The 2018 Melbourne Data Science Conference (MeDaScIn Conference) featured data science career advice from 6 presenters. The conference, held on Wednesday 26 September 2018, was staged at the NAB Arena in Docklands.
Overall, the conference presented some good common sense career advice though there was little “new” material.
This blog post shows notes taken during the presentations.
