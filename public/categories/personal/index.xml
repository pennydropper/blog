      <description>Introduction Health and wellbeing is one of my 5 core values, and I extended our new beginning at the start of 2017 to establish new habits to live these values. The new habits included:
 Cycling to work where possible; Cutting out “gratuitous” sugar, i.e. confectionary and cakes; Reducing the evening meal to practically a snack, thus making it my smallest meal of the day. Following the 7 minute workout 3 days per week, though I’ve embellished the exercises and extended it to a 30 minute workout 3 times per week.</description>
